# What are Addons?

Ember addons are plugins for your Ember app that are created and maintained by the community and which provide you with free to use functionality for your app, including new themes, components, functions and much, much more. You can install any Ember addon that you can find on [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/) by using the `ember install` command. If we, for example, wanted to install the popular Ember addon `ember-simple-auth`, we could type into our terminal while in our app directory

```
ember install ember-simple-auth
```

This would automatically add the Ember addon to our application and preconfigure it. Depending on the addon we can use it in different ways. In the following example, we're gonna install and use and Ember addon to add a map view to our Ember app.


### Exercise 4a: Installing Ember addons - Ember CLI Tutorial Style

First let's add some styling to our Ember application. You can install the addon `ember-cli-tutorial-style` to make your app shine in an instant

- Install in your app directory via `ember install ember-cli-tutorial-style`
- Quit your server by pressing `Ctrl + C` (Windows + Linux) or `Command + C` (Mac) in your terminal window where your server is running
- restart the server by typing `ember server` and hitting enter
- Revisit your Ember app in your browser. What do you see?

The addon that you just installed, added lots of styles via stylesheets to the application automatically. Stylesheets allow you to apply designs and layouts to websites. Stylesheets are written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and even though we won't be able to take a look into this topic during this workshop, you should definitely check out [this great introduction to CSS](https://cssclass.es/materials/first-steps/) or [visit your local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/up-front-ug/) if you are curious to learn more about it.
