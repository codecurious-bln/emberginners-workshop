# An Intro to Components in Ember

## What is a Component?

A component is an EmberObject that can be used to display interactive content in your Ember application. Ember components are used to turn layout, styles and interactive elements into reusable content. Components consist of two parts: a JavaScript component file that defines behavior, and its accompanying Handlebars template that defines the layout of the component.


## Where Can I Find Components?

Components that have been created as part of our application can be used in any page of our application. You can find components that are already part of this application by taking a look into the `app/components` folder. For example, you might see the following:

```bash
- app
  |-- components
      |-- my-component.js
```

## How Can I Use Components?

You can use a component by typing its name in [upper camel case](http://wiki.c2.com/?UpperCamelCase) anywhere in a page's template.
We could add that component created in `app/components/my-component.js` to the rentals page as follows:


```html
<!-- app/templates/rentals.hbs -->
<MyComponent />
```

This process is also described as _invoking a component_. Once the component is invoked, we can check back the `about` page in our browser and see the component displayed right where we left it in the template - after the page's title, but before its descriptive text.


### Exercise 5a: Invoke the rental listing component

As described in the previous section, Ember applications keep components in one single place. Check out your own application for the presence of components using the terminal. Which components are there? Keep in mind that you can use `cd` to move between folders and `ls` to list the contents of a folder.

- Open your application's template for the `rentals` page
- Invoke the component that you already found in your app in `app/templates/rentals.hbs`
- View your rentals page in the browser and see what happened. Attention! You can now access your `rentals` page by visiting your home page at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)


## What are component properties?

Since Ember components are a special type of EmberObjects, which in return are a special type of JavaScript objects, Ember Components also have properties just like any object. What's special about EmberObjects and components though, is that they can have two different types of properties: regular properties and computed properties.


### Regular Properties

Regular properties can be defined on your component directly in two different ways:

- Setting a component property in its respective `.js` file. We can, for instance, set a title property on the following component as such:

```js
// app/components/my-component.js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  title: 'My new component',
});
```
This works exactly as we would expect when declaring a property on a regular JavaScript object. Feel free to take another look at [Step 3](/steps/step-3) for a refresher.

- Or by passing the property into the component right where it is invoked in a template:

```html
<!-- app/templates/another-route.hbs -->
<MyComponent @title="My new component" />

```

Later on, this property is available in our component template at `app/templates/components/my-component.hbs` as such:


```html
<!-- app/templates/components/my-component.hbs -->
{{this.title}}
```

Once we invoke our component in a route and visit that route in our browser, we can see the title displayed right where the component is put into the page.

#### Exercise 5b: Change the component view with properties

- Open your `app/components/rental-listing.js` and see which properties are already available. What did you find?
- Take another look at `app/templates/componets/rental-listing.hbs` - what do you find when you're thinking about the properties that you already found defined in the `rental-listing.js` file?
- Investigate the UI of the rental-listing component in your browser on your `rentals` page
- Go back to `app/templates/rentals.hbs` and pass in the property that is responsible for the image width with the value `true`
- Re-investigate the `rentals` page in the browser. What has happened?

### How can you manipulate properties otherwise?

Passing in a value at the invocation site of a component is not the only way to update component property values. You can also use `.set()` to change property values.


```js
let programmer = EmberObject.create({
  title: 'Ada Lovelace',
  birthyear: 1815,
});
console.log(programmer.birthyear);
// => 1815

programmer.set('birthyear', 1817);
console.log(programmer.birthyear);
// => 1817
```

There's a special functionality you can use for flipping between a special kind of value: Booleans. Boolean values can only have one of two different values: `true` or `false`.

We could e.g. create a variable that describes if the weather is good in our app as follows:

```js
let isWeatherGood = true;
console.log(isWeatherGood);
// => true
isWeatherGood = false;
// => false
```

In contrast to strings, you must not use quotation marks to add a boolean value to a variable in your program. Additionally, you can use the `!` operator in front of your value or variable to turn a boolean into its opposite value. Check it out:

```js
let isWeatherGood = true;
console.log(!isWeatherGood);
// => false
```

Finally, booleans are useful in your app when you want to check for a certain condition and execute code only if it's either true or false. Checks in your code can be made using the `if` operator. Put the variable or value you want to check into braces (`()`) right after the `if` operator and let it follow with curly braces `{}` to wrap the code you want to run. You can use it as follows:


```js
if (/* something you want to check */) {
  // something you want to run in your program if the check is true
}
```

If the variable or value is `true` in the check (between the `()` braces) then the code between the `{}` braces will execute.

 Imagine if you wanted to print "Take your umbrella!" only when the weather was not good (`isWeatherGood = false`). You can then write:


```js
if (!isWeatherGood) {
  console.log("Take your umbrella!");
}
```

because we need the check to be `true` for the `console.log("Take your umbrella!")` to run we need to use the `!` operator. This way the check will only pass when the value of `isWeatherGood` is `false`

#### Exercise 5c: Print to the console under certain conditions

- Open the file [`/demos/demo-5c`](/demos/demo-5c.html) in your browser and in your editor
- Open the browser console. What do you see?
- Go back to the code example in your editor and inspect the JavaScript code. What do you see?
- Update the code so that you will see "Time for a break" printed to your console
- Refresh the page in the browser and check out the console. Did it work?
