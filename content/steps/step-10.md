# What is a deployment?

We can publish and share our web application with everyone on the web by deploying it. This means that we're uploading the files that are necessary for running our web app to a server that is publicly accessible via a specific url. In this final part of the workshop, we'll deploy our app to share them with our Ember friends!

## Exercise 10a: Deploy your application

- Make sure that you moved on to the `Step 10a: FINISH` step of the Github repo to get all last changes to the app into your project
- Go to the [Deployment Guide in the Super Rentals Tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/deploying/) and follow the instructions for the deployment with **surge.sh**
- Visit the website that your app has been deployed to in your browser and celebrate your success in building your very first web application! ✨💖
