This is a workshop to teach those who have never programmed before (or at least never programmed with JavaScript - the programming language of the web) a few basics in web and JavaScript development. This also includes a short introduction into the JavaScript framework EmberJS which we will use to build our very first web application.

## How to follow the workshop

This workshop and its materials are based on the workshop slides that you can find online at [https://emberginners-workshop-slides.netlify.com/](https://emberginners-workshop-slides.netlify.com/).
You can follow the slides and go back to previous lessons at any time, either during or after the workshop.

Do you have feedback or improvements for the workshop materials? Talk to us during the workshop and we'd be looking forward to incorporate your suggestion into the next edition of this project.
